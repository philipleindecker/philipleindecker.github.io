## Description
212° F allows you to automate your cooking!

No more waiting for the water to cook! Now - with 212° F - you can rely on your iPhone to do the waiting for you. 
When the water is boiling and ready to be used, it will notify you by an acoustic alarm.

212° Farenheit = 100° Celsius

### How to use:
1.) Place the iPhone near the pod with the water you want to cook (approx. 30cm radius) and click on Start. 
2.) When the water is boiling, the phone will detect this and notifiy you with an acoustic alarm.
3.) Done

### Restrictions: 
Additional sound or noise typical for a kitchen environment is usually ignored by the trained neural network. Boiling the water with or without a pod lid should also not affect the detection. Sometimes, if the noise is too loud, it might lead to false or no detections. 
The App is trained to detect the sound of only one pod with boiling water. Thus, do not use the App, if you are cooking with multiple pods, pans, ... etc.

### Technical background and Security:
The app uses a pre-trained AI, specifically to detect the sound of boiling water, even in a noisy environment. The app does not send or store any data of the recordings and is also fully functional offline.
