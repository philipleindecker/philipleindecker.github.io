## Abstract

Interpreting and analysing data from physical experiments is a fundamental part of all applied natural sciences in order to validate new theories or eventually proof them wrong. Neuronal networks - with all their variations - can help to find correlations in big sets of data, which otherwise might have never been discovered due to the size and complexity of the given dataset. The goal of this thesis is, to use neural networks in the field of tribology to detect and categorise specific events in a quasi-continuous acoustic signal.
