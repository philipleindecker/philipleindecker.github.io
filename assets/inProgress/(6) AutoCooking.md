## Description
AutoCooking allows you to automatically detect, when water in a pod is boiling and notifies you with an accustic alarm. 

### Usage
Place the iPhone near the pod (30cm radius) and click on Start. When the water is boiling, the phone will indicate this with an accoustic alarm. 

Additional sound or noise typical for an kitchen environment is usually ignored by the trained neural network. Boling the water with or without a pod lid should also not affect the detection.
